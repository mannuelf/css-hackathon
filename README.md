# css holiday hackathon

Let's build a BBC homepage clone.

> Attention to detail.

This hackathon is designed to get you to be detail orientated. We are going to build bbc.com homepage.

# Rules

- write your own CSS to build a near pixel perfect version of the BBC homepage
- only build the:
     - header
     - and 2 rows only as pictured below in the screenshot.
- use all your knowledge about flex box, position absolute & relative, floats, grids, semantic tags to do so.
- do not copy paste code from the BBC website.
- do not look at the BBC's CSS or HTML in the console.
- you may only look at the BBC code to get the width, heights, padding sizes, font sizes and colors.
- when you take a screen shot of the real BBC website and we overlay it ontop of your version most things should match.
